# ðŸš— Electric Car Data Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
Analyze electric car specifications and market trends to uncover insights into battery capacity, range, and efficiency.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- Contains data on electric cars: battery capacity, range, efficiency, price, and manufacturer.
- ~2000 rows, 15 columns.

---

## ðŸ”Ž Analysis Performed
- Cleaned dataset (handled missing values and standardized column names).
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on EV specifications.
- Visualizations: battery capacity vs. range, efficiency vs. price, manufacturer comparisons.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
- Cars with higher battery capacity generally have longer ranges but not always.
- Tesla has high efficiency, but other manufacturers are catching up.
- European and Asian markets lead in EV production and variety.
